# newsapi.github.io
I had to practice XML HTTP Requests. So i've decided to make this mini-project which allows to find news by keywords. Just insert your API key from https://newscatcherapi.com and use this programm to find news. I didn't want to make design for this, but maybe later I'll change it. Also, I'm gonna add some filters for searching news like date, country, etc.
